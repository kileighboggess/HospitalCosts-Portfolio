# COVID-19-Portfolio
This project has two purposes. First, I would like to see what effect COVID-19 has had on the US population in 2020 and again a year later in 2021 to see if case numbers were greater, the same, or less than the year prior (I focused primarily on the month of August). Second, I would like to gather some insight on the mortality rate of these patients, and see if there is a correlation between it and the hospitalization rate. The data for this project was borrowed from the website github.com using a webscraper that can be found on the following github page: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports_us (Thank you CSSE at Johns Hopkins University!). The data consists of location by state, when the data was last updated, confirmed cases, deaths of patients, how many recovered, the mortality rate and the hospital rate.
