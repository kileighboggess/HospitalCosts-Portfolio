# HospitalCosts-Portfolio
This project has two purposes. First, I want to find the age category of people who most frequently made hospital visits and who also had the maximum overhead. Second, I wanted to find the group that displayed the maximum hospitalization and overhead costs. I also wanted to see if age and/or gender played a role in the hospitalization numbers and overall costs of those visits. I have done this by analysizing this data provided by Ravi Chaubey, via Kaggle.com. You can find the dataset, and more information about it here - https://www.kaggle.com/ravichaubey1506/healthcare-cost .
